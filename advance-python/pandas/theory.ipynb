    "**Defiinition:** Changin, organizing, or preparing data to make it useful and easier to understand.\n",
    "**Goal:** To clean, transform, and structure raw data for better usability.\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- **Organizing a grocery list:** Sorting random items into categories like \"fruits\" or \"dairy\".\n",
    "- **Fixing Errors in a student record:** Correcting missing or wrong grades.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Data Analysis**\n",
    "**Definition:** Extracting trends, patterns, and insights from the data to solve problem.\n",
    "**Goal:** To answer questions or identify trends using the data.\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- **Analyzing Sales Trends:** Finding the month with the highest revenue.\n",

    "# What is pandas?\n",
    "- Pandas is a powerful and popular Python library designed for data manipulation (cleaning, transforming, and structuring data) and data analysis (finding trends, patterns, and insights).\n",
    "\n",
    "- It simplifies working with structured datasets like tables, spreadsheets, or time-series data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Key Features:**\n",
    "- Works seamlessly with structured data formats like CSV or Excel\n",
    "- Handles missing values easily\n",
    "- Built on numpy for fast computations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why use Pandas?\n",
    "- **Performance:** Handles millions of rows efficiently.\n",
    "- **Ease of Use:** Beginner-friendly syntax for cleaning and transforming data.\n",
    "- **Integration:** Works with libraries like Matplotlib(visuals) and Scikit-learn(machine learning).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Real-Life Examples**\n",
    "1. **Finance**<br>\n",
    "- Analyzing time-series data like stock prices to identify market trends\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retail**<br>\n",
    "- Tracking inventory and finding the most sold products in a store.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Healthcare**<br>\n",
    "- Analyzing patient records and outcomes from clinical trials"

    "#### **Series:**\n",
    "- A series is a one-dimensional lebeled array that can hold any datatype: integers, floats, strings, or even python objects. Each element in the series has a unique label called index.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is often used to track changes or patterns over time, such as daily temperatures, stock prices, or sales revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Dataframe:**\n",
    "- A dataframe is a two-dimensional labeled data structure in Pandas, similar to a table in a database, an Excel spreadsheet, or a SQL table.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It consist of rows and columns where:\n",
    "1. Rows have indices (labels)\n",
    "2. Columns have names (labels)"
